# Increasing the robustness of DNNs against imagecorruptions by playing the Game of Noise

This repository contains trained model weights and evaluation code for the paper [Increasing the robustness of DNNs against image corruptions by playing the Game of Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06057) by Evgenia Rusak*, Lukas Schott*, Roland Zimmermann*, Julian Bitterwolf, Oliver Bringmann, Matthias Bethge & Wieland Brendel.

We show that a very simple approach -- data augmentation with Gaussian noise -- suffices to surpass state-of-art methods to increase robustness towards common corruptions. Going one step further, we learn the per-pixel distribution to sample noise from adversarially with a simple generative neural network which we call the Noise Generator. Training the Noise Generator and the classifier jointly further increases robustness.

## Evaluate models

To validate our models, run `python3 main.py`. It is necessary to download the model weights first!

Arguments:
 - `--datadir-clean` the top-level directory of the ImageNet dataset (mandatory)
 - `--imagenetc-path` the top-level directory of the ImageNet-C dataset (mandatory)
 - `--model_name` name of the model that should be evaluated (optional, default: `clean`, possible choices: `clean`, `ANT-SIN`, `ANT`, `Gauss_mult`, `Gauss_sigma_0.5`, `Speckle`)
 - `--workers` number of data loading workers (optional, default: 30)
 - `--test-batch-size` number of images in the batch (optional, default: 256)
 - `--device` device for evaluation (optional, default: 'cuda')

The results are saved as txt files.

## Example Usage

### Evaluate our model trained with Speckle noise data augmentation

It is necessary to specify the paths for the ImageNet validation dataset and the ImageNet-C dataset. Then you can run:
```
python3 main.py -e True --model_name Speckle --datadir-clean /path-to-imagenet-val --imagenetc-path /path-to-imagenet-c
```

### Evaluate our best performing model trained with Adversarial Noise Training and on Stylized ImageNet

```
python3 main.py -e True --model_name ANT+SIN --datadir-clean /path-to-imagenet --imagenetc-path /path-to-imagenet-c
```

### Train a robust model with ANT

```
python3 main.py  --mode ANT --datadir-clean /path-to-imagenet --imagenetc-path /path-to-imagenet-c
```

### Train a robust model with ANT+SIN

```
python3 main.py  --mode ANT+SIN --datadir-clean /path-to-imagenet --imagenetc-path /path-to-imagenet-c --datadir-sin /path-to-stylized-imagenet
```

### Train a robust model with Gaussian noise with one specific sigma

```
python3 main.py  --mode Gauss_single --std_gauss 0.5 --datadir-clean /path-to-imagenet --imagenetc-path /path-to-imagenet-c
```
